# OBJECTIVE #

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. Review existing test cases by below steps:
	a. Read test summary and test steps of existing test case to understand the logic and requirements
	b. Check the existing test cases one by one, if test case logic is updated by this JIRA, update test case with new JIRA requirements, then report the update details
	c. Check new generated test cases one by one, if new generated test case is same as existing test case, then use the existing test case and remove new test generated test case

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP
C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP

Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP
C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001
C3-BCC Logic:
6.Ticket logic of BCC will in solution study progress, cover in future version

Review test cases by below steps:
a. Read project document, JIRA request to understand the logic and requirements
b. Check the similar test cases and new generated test cases one by one, if the new generated case already exists in the original test case and the logic is the same, then use the original test case
c. Check the similar test cases and new generated test cases one by one, If the similar test case does not have a similar one with new generated test case, add a new test case
d. Check the similar test cases and new generated test cases one by one, if the new generated case already exists in the original test case, but the logic is different, the original test case should be updated based on the generated test case

# RESPONSE #

a. The output is divided into three parts. The first part is the original test case that can be reused in this JIRA request.

# OBJECTIVE #
Review test cases by below steps:
a. Read project document, JIRA request to understand the logic and requirements
b. Read GENERATED TEST CASES and EXISTING TEST CASES one by one, understand the summary and each step
c. Compare the existing test cases and new generated test cases one by one, i
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is consistent with the existing test case and each step is the same, then it is considered that the existing test case can be used.
   If the new generated test case does not have a similar one with existing test cases. That is considered as the need to add a new test case
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is similar to the existing test case, but the step logic is inconsistent, it is considered that the existing test case needs to be modified, and no new test case needs to be added. Provide a modification plan

# RESPONSE #

a. The output is divided into three parts. The first part is the original test case that can be reused in this JIRA request.

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

Comparison:
- The summary of the existing test case and the new generated test case are similar, but the logic in step 2 is different.
- The existing test case updates the existing ticket when replying with a changed subject, while the new generated test case creates a new ticket with the changed subject.
- Modification Plan: Update the step 2 of the existing test case to match the logic of the new generated test case. The step should update the existing ticket with the changed subject instead of creating a new ticket.

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP
C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

a. Read project document, JIRA request to understand the logic and requirements
b. Read GENERATED TEST CASES and EXISTING TEST CASES one by one, understand the summary and each step
c. Compare the new generated test cases and existing test cases one by one, i
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is consistent with the existing test case and the logic of each step is the same, all step of existing test case meet the needs of Jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case can be used>.
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is similar to the existing test case, but the step logic is inconsistent, and the existing case does not satisfy this jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case needs to be modified>, and do not considered it as the <test cases needs to be added>.

- Update Step 3 to check for Subject1 and Body1 instead of just Subject1
- Add a new step to check that Ticket XL001 is updated with Subject2

Comparison:
- The existing test case checks for updating the ticket with a changed subject, which is similar to the Jira request.
- However, the existing test case does not cover the creation of a new ticket with a changed subject, which is required by the Jira request.

## Test Case 1 ##
- Summary: Reply email with change Subject to create new Ticket
- Steps:
    - Step 1: The summary is similar to existing test case "TicketingLogic-002", but the logic of Step 2 is different. The existing test case updates the existing ticket, while this new test case creates a new ticket. Therefore, the existing test case needs to be modified to align with the Jira request.
    - Step 2: The logic of creating a new ticket with a changed subject is clear and aligns with the Jira request.
    - Step 3: This step checks the creation of ticket XL001, which is consistent with the existing test case.
    - Step 4: This step checks the creation of a new ticket XL002 with Subject2, which aligns with the Jira request.

## Conclusion ##
- Existing test case "TicketingLogic-002" needs to be modified to align with the Jira request.
- One new test case needs to be added to cover the scenario of creating a new ticket with a changed subject.

## Modification Plan ##
- Modify existing test case "TicketingLogic-002" Step 3 to create a new ticket XL002 with Subject2 instead of updating XL001.
- Add a new test case to cover the scenario of creating a new ticket with a changed subject."}

b. Read GENERATED TEST CASES and EXISTING TEST CASES one by one, understand the summary and each step
c. Compare the new generated test cases one by one with the existing test cases.
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is consistent with the existing test case and the logic of each step is the same, all step of existing test case meet the needs of Jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case can be used>.
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is similar to the existing test case, but the step logic is inconsistent, and the existing case does not satisfy this jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case needs to be modified>, and do not considered it as the <test cases needs to be added>. Provide a modification plan
   If the newly generated test case does not have a similar one with existing test cases. That is considered as the <test cases needs to be added>.

## Test Case 1 ##
- Summary: Reply email with change Subject to create new Ticket
- Steps:
  - Step 2 in the new test case is different from Step 3 in the existing test case. The new test case creates a new ticket XL002 with Subject2, while the existing test case updates ticket XL001 from Subject1 to Subject2. This means the existing test case does not meet the requirements of the Jira request.
- Conclusion: Existing test case needs to be modified
- Modification Plan: Update Step 3 in the existing test case to create a new ticket XL002 with Subject2 instead of updating ticket XL001.

## Test Case 2 ##
- Summary: N/A
- Steps: N/A
- Conclusion: Test case needs to be added

## Summary ##
- One existing test case needs to be modified to align with the Jira request.
- One new test case needs to be added to cover the scenario outlined in the Jira request."}

# OBJECTIVE #
Review test cases by below steps:
a. Read project document, JIRA request to understand the logic and requirements
b. Read GENERATED TEST CASES and EXISTING TEST CASES one by one, understand the summary and each step
c. Compare the new generated test cases one by one with the existing test cases.
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is consistent with the existing test case and the logic of each step is the same, all step of existing test case meet the needs of Jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case can be used>.
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is similar to the existing test case, but the step logic is inconsistent, and the existing case does not satisfy this jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case needs to be modified>, and do not considered it as the <test cases needs to be added>. Provide a modification plan
   If the newly generated test case does not have a similar one with existing test cases. That is considered as the <test cases needs to be added>.

a. Existing Test Case Can Be Used:
- Test Case Name: TicketingLogic-002
- Summary: Reply email with changed subject of existing ticket should update ticket
- Steps:
  1. Send New Email to DL1 with Subject1 and Body1, create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
  2. Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL001, Ticket XL001 is created with Subject1 and Body1
  3. Reply this Email to DL1 with Subject2, update ticket XL001 in Test APP
  4. Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL001, Ticket XL001 is updated from Subject1 to Subject2

b. Existing Test Case Needs to Be Modified:
- Test Case Name: TicketingLogic-002
- Summary: Reply email with change Subject to create new Ticket
- Steps:
  1. Send email to DL1 with Subject1 and Body1, create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
  2. Reply to email with Subject1 and change to Subject2, create new ticket XL002 in Test APP
  3. Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL001, Ticket XL001 is created with Subject1 and Body1
  4. Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL002, Ticket XL002 is created with Subject2

Comparison:
- The existing test case logic is to update the existing ticket when replying to an email with a changed subject. However, the JIRA request specifies that a new ticket should be created when replying with a changed subject. Therefore, the existing test case needs to be modified to align with the JIRA request.
Modification Plan:
- Update Step 2 of the existing test case to reflect the creation of a new ticket (XL002) when replying to an email with a changed subject.

c. Test Cases Needs to Be Added:
- There is no existing test case that covers the scenario of creating a new ticket when replying to an email with a changed subject. Therefore, a new test case needs to be added to address this scenario. 

New Test Case to Be Added:
- Priority: Critical
- Name: TicketingLogic-003

# OBJECTIVE #
Review test cases by below steps:
a. Read project document, JIRA request to understand the logic and requirements
b. Read GENERATED TEST CASES and EXISTING TEST CASES one by one, understand the summary and each step
c. Compare the new generated test cases one by one with the existing test cases. Provide modification suggestions according to the following logic
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is consistent with the existing test case and the logic of each step is the same, all step of existing test case meet the needs of Jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case can be used>. And do not need add this new generated test case.
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is similar to the existing test case, but the step logic is inconsistent, and the existing case does not satisfy this jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case needs to be modified>. Provide a modification plan. And do not need add this new generated test case.
   If the newly generated test case does not have a similar one with existing test cases. That is considered as the <new test cases needs to be added>.

{"output":"# RESPONSE #

a. The existing test case can be used:

No existing test case matches the newly generated test case. Therefore, all existing test cases need to be modified or new test cases need to be added.

b. Existing test case needs to be modified:

Existing Test Case: TicketingLogic-002
Summary: Reply email with changed subject of existing ticket should update ticket

Modification Suggestion:
- Update Step 2 to match the JIRA request: Reply email with change Subject1 to Subject 2 should create a new ticket XL002 in Test APP.
- Add an additional step to check that Ticket XL001 is not updated after replying with Subject2.

Comparison:
- The existing test case does not align with the JIRA request as it does not create a new ticket when replying with a changed subject.

c. New test cases need to be added:

New Test Case:
Priority: Critical
Name: TicketingLogic-003
Summary: Reply email with change Subject to create new Ticket
Steps:
1. Send email to DL1 with Subject1 and Body1
2. Reply to email with Subject1 and change to Subject2
3. Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL001
4. Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL002

This new test case covers the scenario where replying to an email with a changed subject should create a new ticket, as per the JIRA request."}

# OBJECTIVE #
Review test cases by below steps:
a. Read project document, JIRA request to understand the logic and requirements
b. Read GENERATED TEST CASES and EXISTING TEST CASES one by one, understand the summary and each step
c. Compare the new generated test cases one by one with the existing test cases. Provide modification suggestions according to the following logic. If any condition is met, there is no need to continue analyzing other conditions, a generated test case cannot satisfy two conditions at the same time
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is consistent with the existing test case and the logic of each step is the same, all step of existing test case meet the needs of Jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case can be used>. And do not need add this new generated test case.
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is similar to the existing test case, but the step logic is inconsistent, and the existing case does not satisfy this jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case needs to be modified>. Provide a modification plan based on existing test case. And do not need add this new generated test case.
   If the newly generated test case does not have a similar one with existing test cases. That is considered as the <new test cases needs to be added>.

Review test cases by below steps:
a. Read project document, JIRA request to understand the logic and requirements
b. Read GENERATED TEST CASES and EXISTING TEST CASES one by one, understand the summary and each step
c. Compare the new generated test cases one by one with the existing test cases. Provide modification suggestions according to the following logic. If any condition is met, there is no need to continue analyzing other conditions, a generated test case cannot satisfy two conditions at the same time and can only exist in one part of the output.
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is consistent with the existing test case and the logic of each step is the same, all step of existing test case meet the needs of Jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case can be used>. And this new generated test case is not to be added.
   If the summary of the newly generated test case is similar to the existing test case, but the step logic is inconsistent, and the existing case does not satisfy this jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case needs to be modified>. Provide a modification plan based on existing test case. And this new generated test case is not to be added.

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP
C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

# OBJECTIVE #
Review test cases by below steps:
a. Read project document, JIRA request to understand the logic and requirements
b. Read GENERATED TEST CASES and EXISTING TEST CASES one by one, understand the summary and each step
c. Analyse the new generated test cases one by one. Provide modification suggestions according to the following logic. 
   condition1: If the summary of the newly generated test case is consistent with the existing test case and the logic of each step is the same, all step of existing test case meet the needs of Jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case can be used>. And this new generated test case is not to be added.
   condition2: If the summary of the newly generated test case is similar to the existing test case, but the step logic is inconsistent, and the existing case does not satisfy this jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case needs to be modified>. Provide a modification plan based on existing test case. And this new generated test case is not to be added.
   condition3: If the newly generated test case does not have a similar one with existing test cases. That is considered as the <new test cases needs to be added>.
   If any condition is met, there is no need to continue analyzing other conditions, just skip other condition. a generated test case cannot satisfy two conditions at the same time and can only exist in one part of the output.
  
# RESPONSE #
The output is divided into three parts. 
a. The first part is the <existing test case can be used>.
b. The second part is the <existing test case needs to be modified>, with existing test case, modification suggestions and comparisons before and after the modification
c. The third part is <new test cases needs to be added>.
