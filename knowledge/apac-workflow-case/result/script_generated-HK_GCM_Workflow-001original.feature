```


**Comments/Explanations:**

*  Placeholders like `<TodayDate>`, `<RN6>`, `<CUSTOMER GROUP>`, `<RNText>`, `<RNRate>`, and `<RNAmount>` are used and defined in the `Examples` table. This allows for data-driven testing.
*  The script closely follows the steps outlined in the test case document.
*  Each step has a comment explaining its purpose in relation to the test case.
*  The script uses the provided web elements and cucumber steps from the template.  If any were missing, custom steps would need to be defined and documented.
*  The `@apacinstruction` tag is used for categorization/filtering of test execution.
*  The scenario outline name clearly indicates the test case ID and summary.


This revised response provides a more complete and compliant Cucumber script based on the provided instructions and template.  It addresses the mandatory components, uses placeholders for data-driven testing, and includes comments to explain the steps and their relation to the test case.  It also demonstrates how to handle missing web elements or steps if necessary. Remember to replace "$xxx systemApacLoginPage" with the actual login page URL.
