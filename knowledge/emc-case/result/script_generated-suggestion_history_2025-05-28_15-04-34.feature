Suggestions: Add Assertions:**  The most critical improvement is to include explicit assertions to validate the expected results.  Instead of just storing values in variables, use `Then` steps to compare those variables with expected values.  For example:, gherkin, Then @vinStatus1 should be "Completed", Then @cainCount1 should be 1, Clarify Test Data:** Ensure the referenced data files (e.g., 010_Testing_Data.xlsx) contain comprehensive data to cover all test scenarios and boundary conditions.  Consider including examples of the data within the feature file itself for better understanding., Improve Comments:** Standardize comment formatting.  Consistently use "Step X" and explicitly mention the user role performing the action in each step's comment., Reduce Duplication:** Explore opportunities to refactor common steps (like clearing data) into reusable background steps or helper functions., Enhance Feature Descriptions:** Provide more detailed descriptions in the Feature modules, including the overall goal and scope of the testing.  Include Test Case IDs for better traceability., Explicitly State Scenario Goals:**  At the beginning of each Scenario Outline, add a brief comment summarizing the specific objective of that scenario., By addressing these points, the Cucumber scripts will be more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand and execute.
Suggestions: Feature Description:** Add more detail about the linking strategy and versioning logic being tested. Include Author information., Scenario Outline:**  Explicitly list parameter combinations and their expected impact within the outline description., Expected Results:** Make expected results more specific, especially for data insertion steps. Consider adding database checks to confirm successful operations., Comments:**  Consistently include Jira ticket references and user roles in step comments.  Remove redundant phrasing like "Test Step X:"., Checkpoints:** Add more comprehensive checks, such as verifying the data within CAIN records., Maintainability:** Extract common setup/cleanup steps into Background sections., Parameterization:** Clarify how placeholders like `<RuleJsonModelFilePath>` are handled during execution.  Consider using Cucumber's data tables or configuration files for managing these parameters., By addressing these points, the Cucumber scripts can be improved in terms of clarity, completeness, and maintainability, making them more robust and easier to use for regression testing.
