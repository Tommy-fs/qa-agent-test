Suggestions: Add missing assertions:**  The most critical improvement is to add "Then" steps to verify the expected outcomes of each action.  This requires writing the corresponding step definitions with assertions., Improve comments:** Make comments more descriptive and concise, focusing on the purpose of each step. Remove general instructions from the feature file., Standardize Feature file headers:** Include Author, Test Case ID, and a more detailed description in the Feature section., Refine the template:**  Update the template to include placeholders for assertions and expected results to guide script generation., Consider browser interactions (if applicable):** If this is a UI test, add steps for browser setup and teardown., Extract common steps:**  Improve maintainability by extracting common steps into reusable step definitions., By addressing these points, the generated Cucumber scripts will be more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand.
Suggestions: Standardize Test Case IDs:** Use a consistent format, such as JIRA issue keys., Clarify Parameter Combinations:**  Explicitly state the parameter combinations being tested in the Scenario Outline description., Strengthen Assertions:**  Replace vague expected results with specific checks and assertions. Verify the creation of resumes and the "failed" status of persons explicitly., Refine Comments:** Make comments more concise and informative, focusing on the action's purpose and the user role involved. Remove redundant "Test Step X" prefixes., Formalize Commenting Style:** Adhere to a consistent commenting style guide., Document Placeholder Resolution:** Clearly explain how placeholders like `<MsgPath>` are resolved., Extract Reusable Steps:**  Identify common steps and extract them into reusable step definitions to reduce code duplication., Use Tags:**  Categorize scenarios using tags for better organization and selective execution., By addressing these points, the generated Cucumber scripts can be significantly improved in terms of clarity, completeness, and maintainability, making them more suitable for automated testing.
