Name: Linking Rule - Two Persons Linked to One Resume
Summary: Verify that two PERSONS can link to the same RESUME if they meet the linking rule criteria, and validate the link count and linking rule code.

Steps：
| No. | Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Clear existing linking rules, overwrite rules, and test data. |  | System clear |
| 2 | Insert the predefined linking rule for this test case. |  See `001_C20250101A-0102_RuleData.json` with Jira No. 0102 | Rule inserted successfully |
| 3 | Insert the predefined overwrite rule for this test case. | See `001_C20250101A-0102_RuleData.json` with Jira No. 0102, ensuring it corresponds to the COMPANY used in test data. | Rule inserted successfully |
| 4 | Insert PERSON1 data with a unique Human Info Code and COMPANY_0102 as the ChannelCode. | See `010_Testing_Data.xlsx` with Jira No. 0102, using a unique Human Info Code and Announcement Date. | PERSON1 data inserted successfully |
| 5 | Trigger COMPONENT1 to process PERSON1. |  | RESUME created for PERSON1 |
| 6 | Insert PERSON2 data with a different Human Info Code but the same COMPANY_0102 as the ChannelCode and a different Announcement Date. | See `010_Testing_Data.xlsx` with Jira No. 0102, using a unique Human Info Code and a different Announcement Date than PERSON1. | PERSON2 data inserted successfully |
| 7 | Trigger COMPONENT1 to process PERSON2. |  | PERSON2 linked to PERSON1's RESUME |
| 8 | Retrieve the RESUME linked to PERSON1. |  | RESUME retrieved successfully |
| 9 | Get the count of PERSONS linked to the retrieved RESUME. |  | Actual Count = 2 |
| 10 | Get the linking rule code used to link PERSON2 to the RESUME. |  | Actual Linking Rule Code =  Expected Linking Rule Code (from `001_C20250101A-0102_RuleData.json`) |
| 11 | Compare the actual count of PERSONS linked to the RESUME with the expected count (2). | Expected Count = 2 | Counts match |
| 12 | Compare the actual linking rule code with the expected linking rule code. | Expected Linking Rule Code (from `001_C20250101A-0102_RuleData.json`) | Linking rule codes match |
| 13 | Clear inserted linking rules, overwrite rules, and test data. |  | System clear |

| 2 | Insert a linking rule with criteria that will not match any existing RESUME. | See `001_C20250101A-0102_RuleData.json` with Jira No. 0102, modify the linking criteria to ensure no match. | Rule inserted successfully |
| 3 | Insert PERSON data with a ChannelCode corresponding to the COMPANY associated with the linking rule. | See `010_Testing_Data.xlsx` with Jira No. 0102 | PERSON data inserted successfully |
| 4 | Trigger COMPONENT1 to process the PERSON. |  | New RESUME created for the PERSON |
| 5 | Verify that a new RESUME is created for the PERSON. |  | RESUME created successfully |
| 6 | Clear inserted linking rules and test data. |  | System clear |
