Summary: Verify VIN linking to existing CAIN based on linking strategy and prevent duplicate CAIN creation.
Steps：
| No. | Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Clear existing linking rules, overwrite rules, and test data. |  |  |
| 2 | Insert the predefined linking rule for the specific COMPANY (derived from ChannelCode). | Refer to 000_RuleJsonModelSchema.json and 001_C20250101A-0102_RuleData.json, Jira No: 0102 | Linking rule inserted successfully. |
| 3 | Insert the predefined overwrite rule for the specific COMPANY (derived from ChannelCode). | Refer to 000_RuleJsonModelSchema.json and 001_C20250101A-0102_RuleData.json, Jira No: 0102 | Overwrite rule inserted successfully. |
| 4 | Insert an existing CAIN. | CAIN data from 010_Testing_Data.xlsx | CAIN created successfully. |
| 5 | Insert a VIN with matching criteria to the existing CAIN and ChannelCode 'COMPANY_0102-DS_0102'. | VIN data from 010_Testing_Data.xlsx, Jira No: 0102 | VIN inserted successfully. |
| 6 | Trigger COMPONENT1 process for the VIN. |  | COMPONENT1 process completes successfully. |
| 7 | Check the VIN status. |  | Completed |
| 8 | Retrieve the count of CAINs. |  | 1 |
| 9 | Retrieve the count of VINs linked to the CAIN. |  | 2 |
| 10 | Retrieve the CAIN version. |  | 2 |
| 11 | Insert a second VIN with matching criteria to the existing CAIN, different attributes impacting versioning, and ChannelCode 'COMPANY_0102-DS_0102'. | VIN data from 010_Testing_Data.xlsx, Jira No: 0102, higher priority attributes | VIN inserted successfully. |
| 12 | Trigger COMPONENT1 process for the second VIN. |  | COMPONENT1 process completes successfully. |
| 13 | Check the second VIN status. |  | Completed |
| 14 | Retrieve the count of CAINs. |  | 1 |
| 15 | Retrieve the count of VINs linked to the CAIN. |  | 3 |
| 16 | Retrieve the CAIN version. |  | 3 |
| 17 | Clear existing linking rules, overwrite rules, and test data. |  |  |
