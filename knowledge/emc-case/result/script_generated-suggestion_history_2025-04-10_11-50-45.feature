Suggestions: Feature Files:** Add Author information and more detailed descriptions to the Feature modules., Scenario Outlines:**  Be more explicit about parameter combinations within the Scenario Outline itself., Expected Results:** Make expected results more specific and actionable.  Include clear assertions and verification methods.  Provide a concrete value for "ExpectedLinkingRuleCode.", Comments:**  Standardize comment format (Step N: [User Role] - [Action Description]), remove redundancy, and be more concise., Checkpoints:** Strengthen checkpoints by specifying how the verification is performed., Code Reuse:** Extract common steps (like data clearing) into reusable components., Browser Interactions:** If applicable, include explicit browser opening and closing steps., By addressing these points, the generated Cucumber scripts can be significantly improved in terms of clarity, completeness, and maintainability, making them more suitable for automated testing.
Suggestions: Add explicit assertions:**  Replace statements like "RESUME created for PERSON1" with steps that actively verify the outcome, e.g., "Then the resume for person "-01021" should exist.", Incorporate data into the script or provide clear access:** While using external data files is acceptable, consider embedding key data values directly into the Examples table for better visibility or provide clear instructions on accessing the external data., Refine comments:** Remove redundant step numbers and consistently include the user role performing the action where relevant., Improve expected result clarity:**  In some scenarios, make the expected results more explicit within the Scenario Outline itself., Consider using a data-driven testing approach within Cucumber:** This would allow for more structured and maintainable test data management., By addressing these points, the Cucumber scripts can be significantly improved in terms of completeness, robustness, and maintainability.
