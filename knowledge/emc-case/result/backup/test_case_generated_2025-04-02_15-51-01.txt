Priority: Critical
Name: Linking Rule Logic - 0102
Summary: Verify two PERSONS can link to one RESUME if they meet the same linking rule and criteria.
Steps：
| No. | Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Clear existing rules and data |  |  |
| 2 | Insert linking rule VLSCD_C20250101A_0102_1 and overwrite rules as defined in 001_C20250101A-0102_RuleData.json | File: 001_C20250101A-0102_RuleData.json | Rules inserted successfully |
| 3 | Insert two PERSON records with different Human.IdentityInfo.Identity but the same Human.ChannelCode (derived from COMPANY_0102), and other required fields as defined in the Jira request and 010_Testing_Data.xlsx. Ensure both PERSONS match the linking rule criteria. | File: 010_Testing_Data.xlsx (modified for two distinct Identities and same Company) | PERSONS inserted successfully |
| 4 | Trigger COMPONENT1 process for both PERSON records. |  | Process completed successfully |
| 5 | Retrieve the RESUME linked to the first PERSON and store it in RESUMEVariable1. | PERSON1 | RESUME retrieved successfully |
| 6 | Retrieve the RESUME linked to the second PERSON and store it in RESUMEVariable2. | PERSON2 | RESUME retrieved successfully |
| 7 | Compare RESUMEVariable1 and RESUMEVariable2. |  | RESUMEVariable1 = RESUMEVariable2 |
| 8 | Get the count of PERSONS linked to RESUME in RESUMEVariable1 and store it in actualCountVariable. | RESUMEVariable1 | Count retrieved successfully |
| 9 | Get the status of both PERSON records and store them in actualStatus, separated by ','. | PERSON1, PERSON2 | Status retrieved successfully |
| 10 | Check the count of PERSONS linked to the RESUME. Compare actualCountVariable with expected result '2'. | actualCountVariable, 2 | actualCountVariable = 2 |
| 11 | Check the status of both PERSON records. Compare actualStatus with expected result 'completed,completed'. | actualStatus, completed,completed | actualStatus = completed,completed |
| 12 | Clear inserted rules and data. |  |  |

Name: Linking Rule Logic - 0102 - Negative Test - Different Criteria
Summary: Verify two PERSONS with different criteria link to different RESUMEs.
Steps：
| No. | Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Clear existing rules and data |  |  |
| 2 | Insert linking rule VLSCD_C20250101A_0102_2 and overwrite rules as defined in 001_C20250101A-0102_RuleData.json | File: 001_C20250101A-0102_RuleData.json | Rules inserted successfully |
| 3 | Insert two PERSON records with different Human.IdentityInfo.Identity and different Human.Classification.Required but the same Human.ChannelCode (derived from COMPANY_0102), and other required fields as defined in the Jira request and 010_Testing_Data.xlsx. Ensure both PERSONS match the linking rule criteria. | File: 010_Testing_Data.xlsx (modified for two distinct Identities and different Required fields) | PERSONS inserted successfully |
| 4 | Trigger COMPONENT1 process for both PERSON records. |  | Process completed successfully |
| 5 | Retrieve the RESUME linked to the first PERSON and store it in RESUMEVariable1. | PERSON1 | RESUME retrieved successfully |
| 6 | Retrieve the RESUME linked to the second PERSON and store it in RESUMEVariable2. | PERSON2 | RESUME retrieved successfully |
| 7 | Compare RESUMEVariable1 and RESUMEVariable2. |  | RESUMEVariable1 != RESUMEVariable2 |
| 8 | Get the count of PERSONS linked to RESUME in RESUMEVariable1 and store it in actualCountVariable1. | RESUMEVariable1 | Count retrieved successfully |
| 9 | Get the count of PERSONS linked to RESUME in RESUMEVariable2 and store it in actualCountVariable2. | RESUMEVariable2 | Count retrieved successfully |
| 10 | Get the status of both PERSON records and store them in actualStatus, separated by ','. | PERSON1, PERSON2 | Status retrieved successfully |
| 11 | Check the count of PERSONS linked to each RESUME. Compare actualCountVariable1 and actualCountVariable2 with expected result '1'. | actualCountVariable1, actualCountVariable2, 1 | actualCountVariable1 = 1, actualCountVariable2 = 1 |
| 12 | Check the status of both PERSON records. Compare actualStatus with expected result 'completed,completed'. | actualStatus, completed,completed | actualStatus = completed,completed |
| 13 | Clear inserted rules and data. |  |  |
