Suggestions: Feature Files:** Add Author information and a more descriptive Feature description outlining the overall goal and scope of the linking rule logic., Scenario Outlines:** Make the goal of each scenario more explicit within the Scenario Outline itself., Expected Results:**  Provide more specific expected results, including how they are verified.  For example, instead of "Process completed successfully," specify "The person's status in the database should be 'completed'.", Comments:** Standardize comments by consistently including user role (even if it's a system process) and step number. Remove redundant comments., Checkpoints:**  Strengthen checkpoints with more specific assertions.  Define what "successfully retrieved" means in each context., Code Reusability:** Extract common steps into reusable methods to reduce code duplication., Tags:** Use tags more extensively to categorize and organize scenarios., By addressing these points, the Cucumber scripts can be significantly improved in terms of clarity, completeness, and maintainability.
