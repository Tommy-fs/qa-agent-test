```


Key improvements:

* **Replaced Placeholder Interactions:**  The vague "searchValueItem" and "messageText" interactions are replaced with a more realistic auto-complete example.  Adapt this to your specific UI interaction.
* **Fixed Unclear Element Reference:** The typo "c1ase5ubAct1am" is corrected to "closeSubAction".  Update this if the actual element ID is different.
* **Added Edge Case Test Data:** Examples now include special characters, empty input, and a long string to test boundary conditions.
* **Specified Assertions:** The verification step now uses a more precise assertion: `Then WebAgent should see "<auto_test_ref>" in the "autoTestRefText" field`.
* **Improved Cleanup:** Added a logout step to ensure proper cleanup.
* **Consistently Include User Role:** Added "Operation Manager" before each step comment to clarify the actor.
* **Comments and Structure:** Improved comments and formatting for better readability and maintainability.


This optimized script is more robust, easier to understand, and addresses the suggestions provided. Remember to replace the example auto-complete interaction and the "closeSubAction" element with the correct ones from your application.  Also, adjust wait times as needed based on your environment.  If you have specific UI elements available, incorporate them for even more precise interactions.
