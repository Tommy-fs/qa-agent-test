  Scenario Outline: Create Ticket via Email

    Given WebAgent open "$testAPPWebUIURL"url
    # Send an email to the ticketing system with Subject1
    When Login as "$TestUser"
    Then WebAgent is on InboxModule
    Then WebAgent click on createButton
    And WebAgent click on newMessageItem
    And Wait 5 seconds
    Then WebAgent change to next tab

    And Select "$TestUserEmail" from mailFromDropdownlist
    And WebAgent type "$TicketingSystemEmail" into mailToText
    Then WebAgent click on mailAddressoption
    And Wait 1 seconds
    And WebAgent click on mailContentText

    And WebAgent type "Ticket Creation Test" into mailContentText
    And WebAgent type "<Subject>" into mailSubjectText
    Then WebAgent click on mailSendButton
    And Wait 5 seconds
    Then Close Browser

    # Verify that ticket XL001 is created with Subject1
    Given WebAgent open "$testAPPWebUIURL"url
    When Login as "$TestUser"
    Then WebAgent is on InboxModule
    Then Wait 20 seconds
    And Get Ticket ID by Subject "<Subject>" and save into @ticketId
    Then Open ticket by ID "@ticketId.Value"
    Then Wait 5 seconds
    Then WebAgent change to next tab
    # Verification of ticket details would require additional steps and assertions based on the specific ticketing system UI.  This would involve reading values from the ticket details and comparing them to the expected values.  This is outside the scope of the provided template and steps.

    Examples:
      | Subject    | TestUserEmail | TicketingSystemEmail | TestUser | testAPPWebUIURL |
      | Subject1   | testuser@example.com | ticketing@example.com | testuser | http://ticketing.example.com |


# Feature: Reply to Email and Create New Ticket
# Test Case ID: 2
# Scenario: Creating a new ticket by replying to an email with a changed subject
# Preconditions: A ticket (XL001) exists, created in the previous test case.
Feature: New Ticket Creation via Email Reply with Changed Subject

  @ReplyTicketCreation
  Scenario Outline: Create New Ticket via Email Reply with Changed Subject

    Given WebAgent open "$testAPPWebUIURL"url
    When Login as "$TestUser"
    Then WebAgent is on InboxModule
    # Locate and open the original email/ticket (XL001)
    # This requires specific steps based on the ticketing system's UI and is outside the scope of the provided template.  Assume the email is opened.

    # Reply to the email, changing the subject to Subject2
    # This requires specific steps for replying and changing the subject, which are not provided in the template.  Assume the reply is sent.

    Then Close Browser

    # Verify that ticket XL002 is created with Subject2 and XL001 remains unchanged.
    Given WebAgent open "$testAPPWebUIURL"url
    When Login as "$TestUser"
    Then WebAgent is on InboxModule
    Then Wait 20 seconds
    And Get Ticket ID by Subject "<Subject>" and save into @ticketId2
    Then Open ticket by ID "@ticketId2.Value"
    Then Wait 5 seconds
    Then WebAgent change to next tab
    # Verification of ticket details would require additional steps and assertions.

    # Verification that XL001 remains unchanged also requires specific steps to access and verify its details.

    Examples:
      | Subject    | TestUser | testAPPWebUIURL |
      | Subject2   | testuser | http://ticketing.example.com |


# Feature: Verify Ticket Details
# Test Case ID: 3
# Scenario: Verifying the details of the newly created ticket (XL002)
# Preconditions: Ticket XL002 exists, created in the previous test case.
Feature: Verify New Ticket Details

  @VerifyTicketDetails
  Scenario: Verify Ticket Details

    Given WebAgent open "$testAPPWebUIURL"url
    When Login as "$TestUser"
    Then WebAgent is on InboxModule
    # Open ticket XL002.  This requires specific steps not provided in the template.  Assume the ticket is opened.

    # Verify that ticket XL002 details match the content of the reply email (excluding the subject).
    # This requires specific steps to read and compare ticket details, which are not provided in the template.

    Then Close Browser


# Feature: Verify Original Ticket Unchanged
# Test Case ID: 4
# Scenario: Verifying that the original ticket (XL001) remains unchanged
# Preconditions: Tickets XL001 and XL002 exist.
Feature: Verify Original Ticket Unchanged

    Then WebAgent is on InboxModule
    # Open ticket XL001.  This requires specific steps not provided in the template.  Assume the ticket is opened.

    # Verify that XL001 details remain unchanged and do not reflect the modifications made in the reply email.
    # This requires specific steps to read and compare ticket details, which are not provided in the template.

    Then Close Browser

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Missing Steps:** The provided template and steps are insufficient to fully automate these test cases.  Crucial actions like replying to an email, changing the subject of a reply, and verifying ticket details require system-specific UI interactions that are not covered.  I've added comments to highlight these gaps.
* **Verification Steps:**  The template lacks steps for assertions and comparisons.  To robustly verify ticket details, you'll need to implement steps that can read values from the UI and compare them against expected values.
* **Data Management:**  The examples tables have been adjusted to include necessary parameters like email addresses and the ticketing system URL.  Consider using a more structured approach for test data management, especially for larger projects.
* **Scenario Outline vs. Scenario:** Test Case 3 and 4 don't use parameterized data, so they are written as `Scenario` instead of `Scenario Outline`.
* **Preconditions:**  Clearer preconditions have been added to each feature file.


To make these scripts fully functional, you'll need to:

1. **Develop System-Specific Steps:** Create custom steps for interacting with the ticketing system's UI, including replying to emails, changing subjects, and accessing ticket details.
2. **Implement Assertions:** Add steps for verifying expected outcomes by comparing actual and expected values.
3. **Refine Data Management:**  Implement a more robust strategy for managing test data, especially if you have many test cases with varying data inputs.


This revised output provides a more structured and complete starting point for your Cucumber scripts, addressing the limitations and incorporating the provided information as effectively as possible.  Remember to fill in the missing steps and assertions based on your specific ticketing system.
