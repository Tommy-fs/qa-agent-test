Feature: Creating New Ticket via Email Reply with Subject Change

  Scenario Outline: Verify New Ticket Creation on Email Reply with Modified Subject

    # Preconditions:
    # 1. A valid user account exists.
    # 2. An initial ticket exists.

    Given WebAgent open "$testAPPWebUIURL"url
    When Login as "$Operation_Manager_India"
    Then WebAgent is on InboxModule

    # Step 1: Create an initial ticket (using existing template logic)
    When WebAgent click on createButton
    And WebAgent click on newMessageItem
    And Wait 5 seconds
    Then WebAgent change to next tab
    And Select "*ICG APAC IND SYSTEM DL"from mailFromDropdownlist
    And WebAgent type "Guo,Qihua Jevons [TECH]"into mailToText
    Then WebAgent click on mailAddressoption
    And Wait 1 seconds
    And WebAgent click on mailContentText
    And WebAgent type "Initial Ticket Content" into mailContentText
    And WebAgent type "Initial Ticket Subject" into mailSubjectText
    Then WebAgent click on mailSendButton
    And Wait 5 seconds
    Then Close Browser

    # Step 2: Get the initial ticket ID
    Given WebAgent open "$testAPPWebUIURL"url
    When Login as "$Operation_Manager_India"
    Then WebAgent is on InboxModule
    Then WebAgent click on inboxIcon
    Then Wait 20 seconds
    And Get Ticket ID by Subject "Initial Ticket Subject" and save into @initialTicketId

    # Step 3: Reply to the email with a modified subject (Simulate user action outside the application)
    # This step is outside the scope of web UI automation and needs to be simulated.
    #  Assumptions:
    #  - The email client used allows subject modification during reply.
    #  - The reply is sent successfully to the ticketing system's email address.
    #  - The modified subject is "Modified Ticket Subject".

    # Step 4: Verify a new ticket is created with the modified subject
    Given WebAgent open "$testAPPWebUIURL"url
    When Login as "$Operation_Manager_India"
    Then WebAgent is on InboxModule
    Then WebAgent click on inboxIcon
    Then Wait 20 seconds
    And Get Ticket ID by Subject "Modified Ticket Subject" and save into @newTicketId

    # Step 5: Verify the initial ticket remains unchanged
    When Open ticket by ID "@initialTicketId.Value"
    Then Wait 5 seconds
    Then WebAgent change to next tab
    # Add assertions to check that the initial ticket content and status are not affected.
    # Example (requires specific web elements for ticket content and status):
    # Then WebAgent check mailContentText value is "Initial Ticket Content"
    # And Check ticket Sub Status is "Open"  (or whatever the initial status should be)


    # Expected Results:
    # 1. A new ticket is created with the modified subject.
    # 2. The original ticket remains unchanged.

    Examples:
      | testAPPWebUIURL | Operation_Manager_India |
      | <Test App URL>  | <Operation Manager User> |


# Comments:
# Step 3 requires manual intervention or integration with an email testing tool to simulate the email reply process.
# Additional assertions in Step 5 are needed to verify that the initial ticket remains unchanged.  These assertions will depend on the specific web elements available for accessing ticket content and status.  Placeholders are provided above.
#  If the application provides an API for creating tickets or interacting with emails, consider using API testing for Step 3 for a more robust and automated solution.
