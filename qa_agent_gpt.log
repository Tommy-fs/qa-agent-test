In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

# OBJECTIVE #
Review test cases by below steps:
a. Read project document, JIRA request to understand the logic and requirements
b. Read GENERATED TEST CASES and EXISTING TEST CASES one by one, understand the summary and each step
c. Analyse the new generated test cases one by one. Provide modification suggestions according to the following logic. 
   condition1: If the summary of the newly generated test case is consistent with the existing test case and the logic of each step is the same, all step of existing test case meet the needs of Jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case can be used>. And this new generated test case is not to be added.
   condition2: If the summary of the newly generated test case is similar to the existing test case, but the step logic is inconsistent, and the existing case does not satisfy this jira request, then it is considered that the <existing test case needs to be modified>. Provide a modification plan based on existing test case. And this new generated test case is not to be added.
   condition3: If the newly generated test case does not have a similar one with existing test cases. That is considered as the <new test cases needs to be added>.
   If any condition is met, there is no need to continue analyzing other conditions, just skip other conditions. a generated test case cannot satisfy two conditions at the same time and can only exist in one part of the output.
  
# RESPONSE #
The output is divided into three parts. 
a. The first part is the <existing test case can be used>.
b. The second part is the <existing test case needs to be modified>. Give Modification Plan, then give the original test case without making any changes, and then give the modified test case based on the original test case
c. The third part is <new test cases needs to be added>.

{"output":"### a. Existing Test Case Can Be Used
There are no existing test cases that can be used as the existing test case does not align with the logic of the newly generated test case.

### b. Existing Test Case Needs to Be Modified
**Modification Plan:**
The existing test case (TicketingLogic-002) needs to be modified to reflect the requirement that replying to an existing ticket with a changed subject should create a new ticket instead of updating the existing one. The steps in the existing test case need to be adjusted to ensure that the expected result aligns with the JIRA request.
