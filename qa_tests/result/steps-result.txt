<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

C3-BCC Logic:
6.Ticket logic of BCC will in solution study progress, cover in future version

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

C3-BCC Logic:
6.Ticket logic of BCC will in solution study progress, cover in future version

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by“NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. xxx system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue.
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in xxx system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by“NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. xxx system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue.
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in xxx system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER creates instruction with full information via New Instruction and do“Maker Submit":CURRENT STATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS set to "PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE is true or not, if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC”:CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete”:CURRENT STATUS set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS set to“COMPLETED".
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, lf QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.
Each workflow limits what operations different roles can perform on instructions in different states.
When testing, you need to test every line of the workflow to ensure that the changes in the requirements are fully covered.


2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER creates instruction with full information via New Instruction and do“Maker Submit", CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING - CHECKER examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE is true or not, if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC”, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete”, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to“COMPLETED".
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, lf QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.
Each workflow limits what operations different roles can perform on instructions in different states.
When testing, you need to test every line of the workflow to ensure that the changes in the requirements are fully covered.
If the requirements change at a certain stage, you need to generate the corresponding stage list step by step during testing, and then test at this stage

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER creates instruction with full information via New Instruction and do“Maker Submit", CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING - CHECKER examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE is true or not, if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC”, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete”, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to“COMPLETED".
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, lf QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

### Comments
- The web elements `newInstructionButton`, `instructionDetailsTextbox`, `submitButton`, `makerSubmitButton`, `reportItemSection`, `uploadMaturityReportTextbox`, `generateItemsButton`, `workflowActionsButton`, `submitToCheckerButton`, `qcRequireCheckbox`, and `completeButton` need to be defined in the system.
- The steps `WebAgent is on newInstructionPage`, `WebAgent see reportItemsDisplayed`, `WebAgent see itemsAutoGenerated`, and `Check Process Status is "DRAWDOWN-QC"` need to be implemented in the system.

These scripts are designed to be clear, concise, and aligned with the provided test cases, ensuring they can be executed effectively within the testing framework.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

C3-BCC Logic:
6.Ticket logic of BCC will in solution study progress, cover in future version

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.
Each workflow limits what operations different roles can perform on instructions in different states.
When testing, you need to test every line of the workflow to ensure that the changes in the requirements are fully covered.
If the requirements change at a certain stage, you need to generate the corresponding stage list step by step during testing, and then test at this stage

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER creates instruction with full information via New Instruction and do“Maker Submit", CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING - CHECKER examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE is true or not, if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC”, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete”, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to“COMPLETED".
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, lf QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.S

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER creates instruction with full information via New Instruction and do“Maker Submit", CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING - CHECKER examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE is true or not, if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC”, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete”, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to“COMPLETED".
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, lf QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format and logic.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

C3-BCC Logic:
6.Ticket logic of BCC will in solution study progress, cover in future version

**Comments:**
- For Test Case 3, since it involves future logic, the script is more of a placeholder.
- The scripts assume the existence of certain web elements and steps, such as `replyButton`, `forwardButton1`, and `forwardButton2`. If these do not exist, they should be defined accordingly.
- The `Check ticket Status` step assumes a method to verify the ticket status, which should be implemented if not available.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.
