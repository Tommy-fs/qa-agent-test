<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

C3-BCC Logic:
6.Ticket logic of BCC will in solution study progress, cover in future version

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

C3-BCC Logic:
6.Ticket logic of BCC will in solution study progress, cover in future version

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by“NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. xxx system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue.
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in xxx system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by“NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. xxx system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue.
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in xxx system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER creates instruction with full information via New Instruction and do“Maker Submit":CURRENT STATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS set to "PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE is true or not, if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC”:CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete”:CURRENT STATUS set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS set to“COMPLETED".
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, lf QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.
Each workflow limits what operations different roles can perform on instructions in different states.
When testing, you need to test every line of the workflow to ensure that the changes in the requirements are fully covered.


2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER creates instruction with full information via New Instruction and do“Maker Submit", CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING - CHECKER examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE is true or not, if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC”, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete”, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to“COMPLETED".
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, lf QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.
Each workflow limits what operations different roles can perform on instructions in different states.
When testing, you need to test every line of the workflow to ensure that the changes in the requirements are fully covered.
If the requirements change at a certain stage, you need to generate the corresponding stage list step by step during testing, and then test at this stage

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER creates instruction with full information via New Instruction and do“Maker Submit", CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING - CHECKER examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE is true or not, if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC”, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete”, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to“COMPLETED".
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, lf QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

### Comments
- The web elements `newInstructionButton`, `instructionDetailsTextbox`, `submitButton`, `makerSubmitButton`, `reportItemSection`, `uploadMaturityReportTextbox`, `generateItemsButton`, `workflowActionsButton`, `submitToCheckerButton`, `qcRequireCheckbox`, and `completeButton` need to be defined in the system.
- The steps `WebAgent is on newInstructionPage`, `WebAgent see reportItemsDisplayed`, `WebAgent see itemsAutoGenerated`, and `Check Process Status is "DRAWDOWN-QC"` need to be implemented in the system.

These scripts are designed to be clear, concise, and aligned with the provided test cases, ensuring they can be executed effectively within the testing framework.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

C3-BCC Logic:
6.Ticket logic of BCC will in solution study progress, cover in future version

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.
Each workflow limits what operations different roles can perform on instructions in different states.
When testing, you need to test every line of the workflow to ensure that the changes in the requirements are fully covered.
If the requirements change at a certain stage, you need to generate the corresponding stage list step by step during testing, and then test at this stage

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER creates instruction with full information via New Instruction and do“Maker Submit", CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING - CHECKER examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE is true or not, if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC”, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete”, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to“COMPLETED".
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, lf QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.S

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER creates instruction with full information via New Instruction and do“Maker Submit", CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING - CHECKER examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE is true or not, if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC”, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete”, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to“COMPLETED".
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, lf QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format and logic.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail

6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

**Comments:**
- For Test Case 3, since it involves future logic, the script is more of a placeholder.
- The scripts assume the existence of certain web elements and steps, such as `replyButton`, `forwardButton1`, and `forwardButton2`. If these do not exist, they should be defined accordingly.
- The `Check ticket Status` step assumes a method to verify the ticket status, which should be implemented if not available.

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

The system is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.
The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling
out loan transaction information. Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done, the ticket
lifecycle is ended. Ticket will be closed as archived data.
Generally, for Normal DL in xxx system, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket, so these business
fields will be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page, after user clicks 'Update Ticket' action button on ticket.
Meanwhile, these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted, after business fields are done and action form is
saved or submitted. These business field value will be shown under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail
page.

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.S

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via New Instruction and do “Maker Submit".
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field user can choose yes or no
    2.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING - CHECKER role examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE field is true or not. 
    if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC” action, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete” action, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE will be set today
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, If QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.S

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via New Instruction and do “Maker Submit".
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field user can choose yes or no
    2.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING - CHECKER role examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE field is true or not. 
    if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC” action, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete” action, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE will be set today
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, If QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

4.Instruction test case guide
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    2. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    3. You need to test a complete work flow in a test case.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.S

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via New Instruction and do “Maker Submit".
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field user can choose yes or no
    2.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING - CHECKER role examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE field is true or not. 
    if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC” action, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete” action, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE will be set today
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, If QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

4.Instruction test case guide
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    2. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    3. You need to test a complete work flow in a test case.

### Comments
- For the web elements and steps not available in the provided lists, I have defined them in comments at the end of each script.
- The `<system_url>` in the examples should be replaced with the actual URL of the system being tested.
- Ensure that the web elements like `completedDateTextbox`, `submitButton`, `completeButton`, `instructionItem`, `submitPaymentCheckerButton`, `returnToMakerButton`, `returnToPaymentMakerButton` are defined in the system for the scripts to work correctly.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.S

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via New Instruction and do “Maker Submit".
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field user can choose yes or no. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user.
    2.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING - CHECKER role examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE field is true or not. 
    if yes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do “Submit to QC” action, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    If no, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do "Complete” action, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, If QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

4.Instruction test case guide
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    2. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    3. You need to test a complete work flow in a test case.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

Instruction test case guide
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    2. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    3. You need to test a complete work flow in a test case.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

Instruction test case guide
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    2. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    3. You need to test a complete work flow in a test case.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

Instruction test case guide
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    2. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    3. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.

Result: 

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.S

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via New Instruction and do “Maker Submit".
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING - CHECKER role examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE field is true or not. 
    if yes, The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER role do “Submit to QC” action, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    If no, The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER role do "Complete” action, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER role will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, If The user who has the  QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If The user who has the QC role need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

Instruction test case guide
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    2. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    3. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    4. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field user can choose yes or no. 
    5. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

Instruction test case guide
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.

</TEST_CASE_EXAMPLE>

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation usersfiling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in  SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team,From, To, Subject, Request Type. Finally,
after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation usersfiling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in  SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team,From, To, Subject, Request Type. Finally,
after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation usersfiling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in  SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team,From, To, Subject, Request Type. Finally,
after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by “NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via New Instruction and do “Maker Submit".
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING - CHECKER role examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE field is true or not. 
    if yes, The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER role do “Submit to QC” action, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    If no, The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER role do "Complete” action, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER role will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, If The user who has the  QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If The user who has the QC role need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

</TEST_CASE_EXAMPLE>

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.

    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction by open“Report item”
    The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XXX system will be based on source files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Report item"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XXX system, KL LOANS OPS PROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actions submit to K LLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via New Instruction and do “Maker Submit".
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING - CHECKER role examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE field is true or not. 
    if yes, The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER role do “Submit to QC” action, CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    If no, The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER role do "Complete” action, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER role will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, If The user who has the  QC role found target instruction has some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If The user who has the QC role need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

This system is a system for creating instruction orders, which have many fields. 
Some require user input, while others are automatically entered by the system and follow different workflows. 
Each order has a corresponding state at each step, 
and users with corresponding permissions can operate the order in the corresponding state to perform actions, 
and then proceed step by step.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via 'New Instruction' button and do “Maker Submit" action.
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field where users need to select yes or no
    2.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER role do “Submit to QC” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    3.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER role do "Complete” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE Field will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER role can do return action back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to “PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the  QC role found can do "Return",
    The instruction will back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER', CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the QC role can do “Complete Drawdown QC”
    Instruction will be set back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER'. CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.
    7.If instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, 
    The role of 'KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING' -CHECKER have access to decided directly 'complete' instruction or 'return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER'.

</TEST_CASE_EXAMPLE>

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

This system is a system for creating instruction orders, which have many fields. 
Some require user input, while others are automatically entered by the system and follow different workflows. 
Each order has a corresponding state at each step, 
and users with corresponding permissions can operate the order in the corresponding state to perform actions, 
and then proceed step by step.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via 'New Instruction' button and do “Maker Submit" action.
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field where users need to select yes or no
    2.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER role do “Submit to QC” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    3.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER role do "Complete” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE Field will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER role can do return action back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to “PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the  QC role found can do "Return",
    The instruction will back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER', CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the QC role can do “Complete Drawdown QC”
    Instruction will be set back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER'. CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.
    7.If instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, 
    The role of 'KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING' -CHECKER have access to decided directly 'complete' instruction or 'return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER'. 
    After "Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

</TEST_CASE_EXAMPLE>

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team,From, To, Subject, Request Type. Finally,
after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team, From email address, To email address, Subject, Request Type. 
Finally, after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team, From email address, To email address, Subject, Request Type. 
Finally, after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
If you click send without filling in the required fields, the system will prompt which fields are not filled in automatically.

The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team, From email address, To email address, Subject, Request Type. 
Finally, after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
If you click send without filling in the required fields, the system will prompt which fields are not filled in automatically.

The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team, From email address, To email address, Subject, Request Type. 
Finally, after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
If you click send without filling in the required fields, the system will prompt which fields are not filled in automatically.

The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. if the requirement is relate for different workflow type(Normal workflow or Document workflow), need create different test case for every workflow type.
2. if the requirement is relate for ticket,the last step must be close ticket to make sure the case is completed
3. if the requirement is relate for ticket workflow(take action in ticket), use one case to test all require point.
4. Mandatory field must be filled in test data column when do 'new Message' action. 
5. can provide who login xmc loan web in test case, for example User who have Operations Manager login XMC Loan web
6. need close browser and reopen URL before change another role login.
7. need got and provide the test data for field in every page from requirement
8. when test filed is mandatory or not, you can create a ticket without entering a value for this field and see if the system will respond with a prompt.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

This system is a system for creating instruction orders, which have many fields. 
Some require user input, while others are automatically entered by the system and follow different workflows. 
Each order has a corresponding state at each step, 
and users with corresponding permissions can operate the order in the corresponding state to perform actions, 
and then proceed step by step.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via 'New Instruction' button and do “Maker Submit" action.
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field where users need to select yes or no
    2.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER role do “Submit to QC” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    3.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER role do "Complete” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE Field will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER role can do return action back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to “PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the  QC role found can do "Return",
    The instruction will back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER', CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the QC role can do “Complete Drawdown QC”
    Instruction will be set back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER'. CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.
    7.If instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, 
    The role of 'KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING' -CHECKER have access to decided directly 'complete' instruction or 'return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER'. 
    After "Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

</TEST_CASE_EXAMPLE>

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.

This system is a system for creating instruction orders, which have many fields. 
Some require user input, while others are automatically entered by the system and follow different workflows. 
Each order has a corresponding state at each step, 
and users with corresponding permissions can operate the order in the corresponding state to perform actions, 
and then proceed step by step.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.The user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via 'New Instruction' button and do “Maker Submit" action.
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field where users need to select yes or no
    2.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER role do “Submit to QC” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    3.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER role do "Complete” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE Field will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER role can do return action back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to “PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the  QC role found can do "Return",
    The instruction will back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER', CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the QC role can do “Complete Drawdown QC”
    Instruction will be set back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER'. CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.
    7.If instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, 
    The role of 'KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING' -CHECKER have access to decided directly 'complete' instruction or 'return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER'. 
    After "Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.
    7. To verify whether an action is available, you must actually trigger the action to see if an error is reported.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team, From email address, To email address, Subject, Request Type. 
Finally, after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
If you click send without filling in the required fields, the system will prompt which fields are not filled in automatically.

The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

1. if the requirement is relate for different workflow type(Normal workflow or Document workflow), need create different test case for every workflow type.
2. if the requirement is relate for ticket,the last step must be close ticket to make sure the case is completed
3. if the requirement is relate for ticket workflow(take action in ticket), use one case to test all require point.
4. Mandatory field must be filled in test data column when do 'new Message' action. 
5. can provide who login xmc loan web in test case, for example User who have Operations Manager login XMC Loan web
6. need close browser and reopen URL before change another role login.
7. need got and provide the test data for field in every page from requirement
8. when test filed is mandatory or not, you can create a ticket without entering a value for this field and see if the system will respond with a prompt.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team, From email address, To email address, Subject, Request Type. 
Finally, after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
If you click send without filling in the required fields, the system will prompt which fields are not filled in automatically.

The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. if the requirement is relate for different workflow type(Normal workflow or Document workflow), need create different test case for every workflow type.
2. if the requirement is relate for ticket,the last step must be close ticket to make sure the case is completed
3. if the requirement is relate for ticket workflow(take action in ticket), use one case to test all require point.
4. Mandatory field must be filled in test data column when do 'new Message' action. 
5. can provide who login xmc loan web in test case, for example User who have Operations Manager login XMC Loan web
6. need close browser and reopen URL before change another role login.
7. need got and provide the test data for field in every page from requirement
8. when test filed is mandatory or not, you can create a ticket without entering a value for this field and see if the system will respond with a prompt.

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team, From email address, To email address, Subject, Request Type. 
Finally, after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
If you click send without filling in the required fields, the system will prompt which fields are not filled in automatically.

The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

1. if the requirement is relate for different workflow type(Normal workflow or Document workflow), need create different test case for every workflow type.
2. if the requirement is relate for ticket,the last step must be close ticket to make sure the case is completed
3. if the requirement is relate for ticket workflow(take action in ticket), use one case to test all require point.
4. Mandatory field must be filled in test data column when do 'new Message' action. 
5. can provide who login xmc loan web in test case, for example User who have Operations Manager login XMC Loan web
6. need close browser and reopen URL before change another role login.
7. need got and provide the test data for field in every page from requirement
8. when test filed is mandatory or not, you can create a ticket without entering a value for this field and see if the system will respond with a prompt.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team, From email address, To email address, Subject, Request Type. 
Finally, after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
If you click send without filling in the required fields, the system will prompt which fields are not filled in automatically.

The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team, From email address, To email address, Subject, Request Type. 
Finally, after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
If you click send without filling in the required fields, the system will prompt which fields are not filled in automatically.

The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

XMC Loan is an operational workflow application utilized by the Global Loans Operations team to source all workflow items,
including client requests and daily processing items in support of BAU activities and special remediation projects.

The ticket as main entity in this application was created by email. Ticket carries business fields to offer Operation users filling out loan transaction information,
Then, ticket will go to workflow and pend for reviewing. After all Approval is done.the ticket lifecycle is ended, Ticket will be closed as archived data.

Ticket generation has two ways in SYSTEM, THe first one is via Create New entrance to creating it,
The operations step is clicking New Message button and open New Message page,
then, filling out mandatory fields including Processing Team, From email address, To email address, Subject, Request Type. 
Finally, after these mandatory fields are are done, click send. XMC will create this ticket for this email.
If you click send without filling in the required fields, the system will prompt which fields are not filled in automatically.

The second way is XMC receiving incoming email(This incoming email is first time to receive in XMC),
then.system will create new ticket for this incoming email.

Generally, for Normal DL in XMC, all business field is configured in Update Ticket action form on ticket,
so these business fields wil be displayed in the right area of ticket detail page,
after user clicks "Update Ticket' action button on ticket.Meanwhile,
these business field also need to be configured under 'Additional Details' section in the left area of ticket detail page for presenting these business field value that user saved or submitted.
after business field are done and action form saved or submitted. 
These business field value will be shown under "Additional Details section in the left area of ticket detail page.

1. if the requirement is relate for different workflow type(Normal workflow or Document workflow), need create different test case for every workflow type.
2. if the requirement is relate for ticket,the last step must be close ticket to make sure the case is completed
3. if the requirement is relate for ticket workflow(take action in ticket), use one case to test all require point.
4. Mandatory field must be filled in test data column when do 'new Message' action. 
5. can provide who login xmc loan web in test case, for example User who have Operations Manager login XMC Loan web
6. need close browser and reopen URL before change another role login.
7. need got and provide the test data for field in every page from requirement
8. when test filed is mandatory or not, you can create a ticket without entering a value for this field and see if the system will respond with a prompt.

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.
    7. To verify whether an action is available, you must actually trigger the action to see if an error is reported.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.
    7. To verify whether an action is available, you must actually trigger the action to see if an error is reported.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

</QA_OBJECT>

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

This system is a system for creating instruction orders, which have many fields. 
Some require user input, while others are automatically entered by the system and follow different workflows. 
Each order has a corresponding state at each step, 
and users with corresponding permissions can operate the order in the corresponding state to perform actions, 
and then proceed step by step.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via 'New Instruction' button and do “Maker Submit" action.
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Other roles are not allowed to create instructions
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field where users need to select yes or no
    2.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER role do “Submit to QC” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    3.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER role do "Complete” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE Field will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER role can do return action back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to “PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the  QC role found can do "Return",
    The instruction will back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER', CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the QC role can do “Complete Drawdown QC”
    Instruction will be set back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER'. CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.
    7.If instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, 
    The role of 'KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING' -CHECKER have access to decided directly 'complete' instruction or 'return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER'. 
    After "Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.).

Result: 

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

</QA_OBJECT>

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

This system is a system for creating instruction orders, which have many fields. 
Some require user input, while others are automatically entered by the system and follow different workflows. 
Each order has a corresponding state at each step, 
and users with corresponding permissions can operate the order in the corresponding state to perform actions, 
and then proceed step by step.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via 'New Instruction' button and do “Maker Submit" action. Other roles are not allowed to create instructions
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field where users need to select yes or no
    2.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER role do “Submit to QC” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    3.If QC REQUIRE field is false ,The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER role do "Complete” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE Field will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER role can do return action back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to “PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the  QC role found can do "Return",
    The instruction will back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER', CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the QC role can do “Complete Drawdown QC”
    Instruction will be set back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER'. CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.
    7.If instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, 
    The role of 'KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING' -CHECKER have access to decided directly 'complete' instruction or 'return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER'. 
    After "Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

</TEST_CASE_EXAMPLE>

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.
    7. To verify whether an action is available, you must actually trigger the action to see if an error is reported.

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

This system is a system for creating instruction orders, which have many fields. 
Some require user input, while others are automatically entered by the system and follow different workflows. 
Each order has a corresponding state at each step, 
and users with corresponding permissions can operate the order in the corresponding state to perform actions, 
and then proceed step by step.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via 'New Instruction' button and do “Maker Submit" action. Other roles are not allowed to create instructions
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field where users need to select yes or no
    2.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER role do “Submit to QC” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    3.If QC REQUIRE field is false ,The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER role do "Complete” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE Field will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER role can do return action back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to “PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the  QC role found can do "Return",
    The instruction will back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER', CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the QC role can do “Complete Drawdown QC”
    Instruction will be set back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER'. CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.
    7.If instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, 
    The role of 'KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING' -CHECKER have access to decided directly 'complete' instruction or 'return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER'. 
    After "Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

</TEST_CASE_EXAMPLE>

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. Creating instructions can only be done for specific roles, which you need to find in the documentation.
    5. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    6. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    7. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    8. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.
    9. To verify whether an action is available, you must actually trigger the action to see if an error is reported.

3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<PROJECT_DOCUMENT>

This system is a system for creating instruction orders, which have many fields. 
Some require user input, while others are automatically entered by the system and follow different workflows. 
Each order has a corresponding state at each step, 
and users with corresponding permissions can operate the order in the corresponding state to perform actions, 
and then proceed step by step.

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.user who has the KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER role can create instruction with full information via 'New Instruction' button and do “Maker Submit" action. Other roles are not allowed to create instructions
    The instruction's CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "KL LOANS  - PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    Additional: THIRD PARTY PAYMENT is a field where users need to select yes or no
    2.If QC REQUIRE field is true ,The user who has the KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER role do “Submit to QC” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to "DRAWDOWN-QC".
    3.If QC REQUIRE field is false ,The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER role do "Complete” action, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED".
    COMPLETED DATE Field will be set today, Additional: COMPLETED DATE This is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. Before this state, the field of COMPLETED DATE is empty.
    4.The user who has the  KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER role can do return action back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, 
    CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to “PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the  QC role found can do "Return",
    The instruction will back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER', CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS will be set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If instruction in “DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, The user who has the QC role can do “Complete Drawdown QC”
    Instruction will be set back to 'KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER'. CURRENT STATUS will be set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS will be set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.
    7.If instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, 
    The role of 'KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING' -CHECKER have access to decided directly 'complete' instruction or 'return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER'. 
    After "Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS will be set to “COMPLETED”.

</TEST_CASE_EXAMPLE>

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. Creating instructions can only be done for specific roles, which you need to find in the documentation.
    5. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    6. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    7. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    8. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.
    9. To verify whether an action is available, you must actually trigger the action to see if an error is reported.

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.Read the test case example to understand basic format.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based  on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent

7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step
11. If multiple cases have roughly the same steps but different verifications, please merge the cases.
12. Don't translate the content of Jira. You need to analyze the documents, examples and Jira together to come up with a reasonable test case.

<TEST_CASE_GUIDE>

1. **Clarity of User Roles** 
   - [ ] Each step of the test case should clearly specify the user role performing the action to ensure the operating entity is unambiguous. 
   - [ ] If consecutive steps are performed by the same user role, repeated labeling can be omitted; however, when the user role changes, the new role must be explicitly indicated.

2. **Standardization of Test Data** 
   - [ ] Specific data involved in the test case (e.g., input values, configuration parameters, environment variables, etc.) should be clearly annotated in the test data section, along with their source or generation rules. 
   - [ ] For dynamically generated data, describe its generation logic or range to ensure test repeatability and consistency.

3. **Completeness of Checkpoints** 
   - [ ] Test cases should include explicit checkpoints to verify whether the system behavior meets expectations. Checkpoints should cover multiple dimensions such as functionality, interface, and performance, for example: 
     - Correctness of field values (e.g., input validation, calculation results, etc.). 
     - Display status of interface elements (e.g., buttons, menus, prompt messages, etc.). 
     - Timeliness and accuracy of system responses (e.g., API return results, database updates, etc.). 
   - [ ] Each checkpoint should clearly describe the expected result and compare it with the actual result to ensure the rigor of the test.

4. **Readability and Maintainability of Test Cases** 
   - [ ] Test case descriptions should be concise and unambiguous, making it easy for team members to understand and execute. 
   - [ ] The structure of test cases should be modular to facilitate future maintenance and expansion, such as organizing cases through grouping or tagging. 
   - [ ] For complex scenarios, comments or explanations can be added to help testers quickly understand the context.

5. **Coverage and Boundary Conditions** 
   - [ ] Test cases should cover core functionalities, common scenarios, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of features. 
   - [ ] Special attention should be paid to boundary conditions (e.g., upper and lower limits of input values, special characters, null values, etc.) to verify the robustness of the system. 
   - [ ] For scenarios involving multiple languages, devices, or resolutions, corresponding test cases should be designed to ensure compatibility.

6. **Dependency and Environment Management** 
   - [ ] Test cases should clearly annotate their dependencies on external conditions (e.g., database state, network environment, third-party services, etc.) to facilitate environment setup and issue troubleshooting. 
   - [ ] For test cases requiring specific environments or configurations, detailed setup instructions should be provided to ensure test executability.

7. **Adaptability for Automation** 
   - [ ] If test cases are intended for automated testing, ensure that their steps are clearly described and scriptable, avoiding reliance on manual judgment. 
   - [ ] For automated testing, annotate key operational elements (e.g., button IDs, input field names, etc.) to facilitate script writing and maintenance.

8. **Work flow test guide** 
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. Creating instructions can only be done for specific roles, which you need to find in the documentation.
    5. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    6. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    7. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    8. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.
    9. To verify whether an action is available, you must actually trigger the action to see if an error is reported.
