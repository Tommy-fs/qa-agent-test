<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP

C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001

C3-BCC Logic:
6.Ticket logic of BCC will in solution study progress, cover in future version

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

HK Instruction Workflow
1. Workflow type
“HK GCM" Workflow is one workflow of HK KL Loans Workflow which created by KL LOANSOPS-PROCESSING -MAKER.

2.HK GCM Instruction Creation
    1.Create Instruction by“NewInstruction” button
    There is a role could manually create new instruction, who are KL LOANSOPS-PROCESSING -MAKER role, can created instruction with button “NewInstruction-STARS" to run KL Loans workflow-HK GCM.
    2.Create Instruction byopen“Report ltem”
    KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -MAKER and KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING-CHECKER have access to Upload Maturity Report both. XMC will be based onsource files and logic mapping auto generated items and display in "Reporttem"or“Report ltem Pending"Queue. 
    After Maturity Report uploaded and generated in XMC, KL LOANS OPSPROCESSING -MAKER can open item then follow KL Loans Workflow actionssubmit to KLLOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER.

3.HKGCM Workflow actions and Status change
    1.KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER creates instruction with full informationvia New Instruction and do“Maker Submit":CURRENT STATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS set to"PROCESSING-CHECKER”.
    2.KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER examines whether the target instruction can be approved or not.
    3.If instruction can be approved, system checking QC REQUIRE is true or not, ifyes, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER do“Submit to QC”:CURRENT STATUS keeps “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS set toDRAWDOWN-OC".If nO, KL LOANS OPS- PROCESSING -CHECKER do"Complete”:CURRENT STATUS set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS set to“COMPLETED".
    4.If instruction cannot be approved, KL LOANS OPS-PROCESSING -CHECKER will return instruction back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENT STATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS set to“PROCESSING-MAKER-MANUAL”.
    5.After instruction in“DRAWDOWN-QC" stage, lf QC role found target instructionhas some issue, QC will do "Return":The instruction will back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER, CURRENTSTATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS set to"PROCESSING - MAKER-MANUAL"
    6.If QC need do work and is done on it, QC will do “Complete Drawdown QC”:Instruction will be set back to KL LOANS OPS - PROCESSING -CHECKER.CURRENT STATUS set to “KL LOANS OPS”, PROCESS STATUS set to“PROCESSING-CHECKER-QC CHECKED”.lf instruction's CURRENT STATUS is “KL LOANS OPS", PROCESS STATUS is"PROCESSING -CHECKER -QC CHECKED”, KL LOANS OPS -PROCESSING -CHECKER have access to decided directly complete instruction or return to KLLOANS OPS - PROCESSING -MAKER. After"Complete” action, instructionCURRENT STATUS set to “COMPLETED", PROCESS STATUS set to “COMPLETED”.
