Result: 

<QA_CONTEXT>

We are a software company, and you are our software test expert, your responsibility is to create test cases.

</QA_CONTEXT>

<QA_OBJECT>

I need you create function test cases by project documents and JIRA request:
1. Read project documents to understand whole project's goals, features, and user expectations.
2. Review JIRA requests to understand the specific functionalities or changes, you only need to create test cases to test this JIRA request, not for whole project document
3. Identify the components or modules of the software that need to be tested based on the project documentation and JIRA requests. Categorize them based on their functional areas
4. Based on the identified components and objectives, create test scenarios. Test scenarios outline the high-level functionality that needs to be tested. Each scenario typically consists of a sequence of steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
5. Break down each test scenario into detailed test cases. Test cases should cover various possible inputs, configurations, boundary conditions, and potential error scenarios. Ensure that each test case is unambiguous and independent
6. Determine the necessary test data for executing the test cases. This may involve identifying specific inputs, preconditions, and expected results for each test case. Test data should cover both typical and edge cases.
7. Prioritize the test cases based on factors like criticality, risk, and dependencies to 5 levels. Organize them into test suites to facilitate efficient test execution order by priority
8. Output test suites with test cases as a table
9. Test case should have Priority, Name, Summary, Steps.
10. Write Test Steps as table with  table heads : |No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |, Test Data means the input in Test Step

Ticketing Logic
In order  to auto create ticket within APAC Loan email management application following 2 steps are required:
1.Loan Ops Processing queue/DL should be on-boarded  has an ACTIVE Rule created.
2.Loan Ops has added Prod DL (or UAT DL)as a sub-DL within Loan Ops Prod DL.
Once above 2 steps are completed, an incoming email on Loan Op Prod DL with auto-create a ticket and will be
shown under Processing Queue in the left rail within Open Tickets sub-folder

C1-Create new ticket ID:
New tickets logic DL + Subject + first email body
detect new ticket logic is :Receiver Email Address + subject (exclude "RE"/"FW") + first email body, example, you send email 1 to CA UAT, will create ticket 001;
if you reply or forward(don't change subject or email 1 body) won't create new ticket will update in one ticket;
if you change subject or email 1 body will create new ticket;
if you send email 1 with subject 1 to CA UAT will create ticket ,
if you send email 2 with same body and subject to CA UAT, will create new ticket, because you don't reply or FW email, you totally new one email
1. Send email 1 to Email Address1 with Subject 1, will create new ticket XL001 in Test APP
2. Reply or forward email 1 with change Subject to Subject 2, will create ticket XL002 in Test APP
3. After ticket closed in Test APP, reply and forward email will create new ticket in Test APP
C2-Follow previous ticket ID:
4.Reply email 1 with subject 1 will follow in same ticket XL001
5.Forward email and email to/email CC contain DL1 will be captured in same ticket XL001
C3-BCC Logic:
6.Ticket logic of BCC will in solution study progress, cover in future version

<TEST_CASE_EXAMPLE>

Priority: Critical
Name: TicketingLogic-001
Summary: Send new email with same body and subject as existing ticket should create new ticket
Stepsï¼š
|No.| Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result |
| 1 | Send New Email to DL1 with Subject1 and Body1 | DL1, Subject1, Body1| Create new ticket XL001 in Test APP |
| 2 | Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL001 | XL001 | Ticket XL001 is created with Subject1 and Body1 |
| 3 | Send New Email to DL1 with Subject1 and Body1 | DL1, Subject1, Body1| Create new ticket XL002 in Test APP |
| 4 | Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL001 | XL001 | Ticket XL001 is not updated |
| 5 | Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL002 | XL002 | Ticket XL002 is created with Subject1 and Body1 |

Result: 
Priority: Critical 
Name: TicketingLogic-002 
Summary: Reply email with change Subject to create new ticket 
Steps: 
| No. | Test Step | Test Data | Expected Result | 
| 1 | Send email with Subject1 to create new ticket XL001 | Subject1 | Create new ticket XL001 in Test APP | 
| 2 | Reply email with change Subject1 to Subject 2 | Subject1, Subject2 | Create new ticket XL002 in Test APP | 
| 3 | Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL001 | XL001 | Ticket XL001 is not updated | 
| 4 | Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL002 | XL002 | Ticket XL002 is created with Subject2 |

Result: 
Here's a Cucumber script for the provided test case, following the guidelines and using the available web elements and steps:

Feature: Ticketing Logic

  @critical
  Scenario Outline: TicketingLogic-002 Reply email with change Subject to create new ticket
    Given WebAgent open "<testAPPWebUIURL>" url
    When Login as "<User>"
    Then WebAgent is on InboxModule

    # Step 1: Send email with Subject1 to create new ticket XL001
    Then WebAgent click on createButton
    And WebAgent click on newMessageltem
    And Wait 5 seconds
    Then WebAgent change to next tab
    And WebAgent type "<Subject1>" into mailSubjectText
    And WebAgent type "Test content for ticket XL001" into mailContentText
    Then WebAgent click on mailSendButton
    And Wait 5 seconds

    # Step 2: Reply email with change Subject1 to Subject2
    Then WebAgent click on inboxIcon
    And Wait 20 seconds
    And Get Ticket ID by Subject "<Subject1>" and save into @ticketId1
    When Open ticket by ID "@ticketId1.Value"
    Then Wait 5 seconds
    Then WebAgent change to next tab
    And WebAgent type "<Subject2>" into mailSubjectText
    And WebAgent type "Reply content for ticket XL002" into mailContentText
    Then WebAgent click on mailSendButton
    And Wait 5 seconds

    # Step 3: Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL001
    Given WebAgent open "<testAPPWebUIURL>" url
    When Login as "<User>"
    Then WebAgent is on InboxModule
    Then WebAgent click on inboxIcon
    And Wait 20 seconds
    And Open ticket by ID "@ticketId1.Value"
    Then Wait 5 seconds
    Then Check ticket Status is "Not Updated"

    # Step 4: Open Test APP WebUI to check ticket XL002
    Then WebAgent click on inboxIcon
    And Wait 20 seconds
    And Get Ticket ID by Subject "<Subject2>" and save into @ticketId2
    When Open ticket by ID "@ticketId2.Value"
    Then Wait 5 seconds
    Then Check ticket Status is "Created with Subject2"
    Then Close Browser

  Examples:
    | testAPPWebUIURL | User   | Subject1 | Subject2 |
    | http://testapp.com | Tester | Subject1 | Subject2 |

# Comments:
# If there are no available webui cucumber steps or web elements that you want to use, you can customize a new one and display it in a table.
# For example, if you need a step to verify the ticket status, you can define it as:
# @Then("^Check ticket Status is \"([^\"]*)\"$")


### Explanation:
