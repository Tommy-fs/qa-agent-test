**Comments:**
- For Test Case 3, since it involves future logic, the script is more of a placeholder.
- The scripts assume the existence of certain web elements and steps, such as `replyButton`, `forwardButton1`, and `forwardButton2`. If these do not exist, they should be defined accordingly.
- The `Check ticket Status` step assumes a method to verify the ticket status, which should be implemented if not available.
