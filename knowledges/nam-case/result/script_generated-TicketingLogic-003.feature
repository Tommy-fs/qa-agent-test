  Scenario Outline: TicketingLogic-003 - Validate 'Auto Test Ref#' field behavior

    # Preconditions: User is logged in as Operations Manager

    # Test Case ID: 1
    Given WebAgent open "<XMC Loan web URL>" url
    And Login SSO as "<Operations Manager SSO ID>"
    And Wait 5 seconds
    And Login as "<Operations Manager ID>"

    # Test Case ID: 2
    # Create a new ticket
    And WebAgent click on inboxIcon
    And Wait 5 seconds
    Then WebAgent click on createButton
    And WebAgent click on newMessageItem
    And Wait 5 seconds
    Then WebAgent change to next tab
    Then WebAgent is on newMessagePage
    And Select "<Processing Team>" from processingTeamDropdownlist
    And Select "<From Email Address>" from fromDropdownlist
    And WebAgent type "<To Email Address>" into toText
    And Wait 2 seconds
    And WebAgent click on searchValueItem # Assuming this is needed to select the To address
    And WebAgent click on messageText # Assuming this clears the message text area
    And WebAgent type "<Subject>" into subjectText
    And Wait 5 seconds
    And WebAgent type "<Request Type>" into requestTypeDropdownlist
    And Wait 2 seconds
    And WebAgent click on searchValueItem # Assuming this is needed to select the Request Type
    And WebAgent click on messageText # Assuming this clears the message text area
    Then WebAgent click on sendButton
    And Wait 10 seconds

    # Test Case ID: 3
    # Open the created ticket
    Then WebAgent change to tab "XMC Loan"
    Then WebAgent is on LoanPage
    And Wait 60 seconds
    And WebAgent click on allTicketsInbox
    And Wait 20 seconds
    And WebAgent click on clearUserPreferenceButton
    And Wait 10 seconds
    And Get Ticket ID by Subject "<Subject>" and save into @ticketId
    When Open ticket by ID "@ticketId.Value"
    Then Wait 5 seconds
    Then WebAgent change to next tab
    Then WebAgent is on workflowPage


    # Test Case ID: 4, 5, 6
    # Check and verify 'Auto Test Ref#' field presence
    Then WebAgent click on updateTicketAction
    Then WebAgent see autoTestRefText

    # Test Case ID: 7, 8
    # Update ticket without 'Auto Test Ref#'
    # Fill other mandatory fields (using example data for now, replace with actual mandatory fields)
    And Select "<Processing Team>" from processingTeamDropdownlist
    And Select "<From Email Address>" from fromDropdownlist
    And WebAgent type "<To Email Address>" into toText
    And Wait 2 seconds
    And WebAgent click on searchValueItem # Assuming this is needed to select the To address
    And WebAgent click on messageText # Assuming this clears the message text area
    And WebAgent type "<Subject>" into subjectText
    And Wait 5 seconds
    And WebAgent type "<Request Type>" into requestTypeDropdownlist
    And Wait 2 seconds
    And WebAgent click on searchValueItem # Assuming this is needed to select the Request Type
    And WebAgent click on messageText # Assuming this clears the message text area
    Then WebAgent click on updateTicketButton
    And Wait 4 seconds

    # Test Case ID: 9
    # Check 'Auto Test Ref#' in Additional Details (This requires a step to navigate to Additional Details if it's not directly visible)
    #  And "Additional Details" section should not contain "Auto Test Ref#"  (This requires a custom step)
    #  This step needs implementation based on how "Additional Details" and its contents are accessed.

    # Test Case ID: 10
    # Close the ticket
    Then WebAgent click on closeParentAction
    Then Wait 1 seconds
    # Assuming 'c1ase5 ubAct1am' is the correct element ID for closing.  Please verify and correct if needed.
    Then WebAgent click on c1ase5 ubAct1am 
    Then Wait 5 seconds
    Then check "Status" Ticketvalue is "Closed"
    Then check "Sub Status" Ticketvalue is "Closed"
    Then WebAgent click on expandAuditTrail
    And Wait 1 seconds
    Then Close Browser


  Examples:
    | XMC Loan web URL | Operations Manager SSO ID | Operations Manager ID | Processing Team | From Email Address | To Email Address | Subject | Request Type |
    |  Your URL Here   | Your SSO ID Here         | Your User ID Here     | *GT CN DevTest | TESTFROM1@CITI.COM | TESTTO1@CITI.COM  | Test Ticket | Normal DL    |

# Custom step needed for verifying absence of 'Auto Test Ref#' in Additional Details.
#  This needs to be implemented based on how the application exposes the Additional Details section.
#  Example (assuming the Additional Details section has a specific ID):
#  @Then("Additional Details section should not contain \"([^\"]*)\"")
#  public void additional_details_should_not_contain(String text) {
#      WebElement additionalDetailsSection = driver.findElement(By.id("additionalDetailsSection"));
#      assertThat(additionalDetailsSection.getText(), not(containsString(text)));
#  }


```


Key improvements and considerations:

* **Clearer Feature Description:**  The feature description now clearly states the purpose of the test.
* **Test Case Mapping:** Each step is now linked to the corresponding Test Case ID for better traceability.
* **Preconditions:** Added a precondition for the user being logged in.
* **Placeholders:**  Placeholders like `<XMC Loan web URL>` and `<Operations Manager ID>` are used in the Examples table, making the script more reusable.
* **Custom Step for Additional Details:**  A comment and example implementation are provided for the missing step to check the "Auto Test Ref#" in the Additional Details section.  You'll need to adapt this based on your application's structure.
* **Corrected Element IDs:**  The `c1ase5 ubAct1am` element ID looks suspicious.  Please double-check and correct it in the script.
* **Comments:**  Improved comments to explain the purpose of each section and highlight areas needing attention.
* **Error Handling:**  Consider adding error handling (e.g., using `try-catch` blocks) to make the script more robust.


This revised version provides a more structured and maintainable Cucumber script that directly addresses the provided test cases.  Remember to replace the placeholders with actual values and implement the custom step for verifying the "Auto Test Ref#" field in the Additional Details section.
