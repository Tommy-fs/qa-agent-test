  Examples:
    | systemURL         | ssoUsername | username | processingTeam        | fromEmail        | toEmail          | autoTestRef |
    | <your_system_url> | <your_sso>  | <your_id> | *Test processing DL | TESTFROM1@CITI.COM | TESTTO1@CITI.COM | TEST123     |


```


**Explanation and Considerations:**

*  Placeholders like `<your_system_url>`, `<your_sso>`, `<your_id>` need to be replaced with actual values.
*  The element ID `c1ase5 ubAct1am` for closing the ticket seems like a typo and needs to be verified and corrected.  If the correct web element is not available, a new step definition needs to be created.
*  This script combines all test cases into a single scenario outline for efficiency.
*  Error handling and additional assertions can be added for robustness.
*  The script assumes the existence of the specified web elements and step definitions. If they are not available, they need to be defined.  For example, if the `autoTestRefText` element is not defined, you'll need to add its definition to the web elements section and potentially create a new step definition to interact with it.


This revised script provides a more structured and comprehensive approach to testing the ticket management functionality.  It adheres to Cucumber best practices and provides clear explanations for each step. Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual values and verify the web element IDs for accurate execution.
