    @Ticket @Regression @TicketingLogic-002
    Scenario Outline: Verify Auto Test Ref# field functionality

        # ***************************************************
        # STEP 1: Operations Manager login and create a ticket
        # ***************************************************
        Given WebAgent open "<loan_web_url>" url
        And Login SSO as "<sso_username>"
        And Wait 5 seconds
        And Login as "<system_username>"
        And WebAgent click on inboxIcon
        And Wait 5 seconds
        Then WebAgent click on createButton
        And WebAgent click on newMessageItem
        And Wait 5 seconds
        Then WebAgent change to next tab
        Then WebAgent is on newMessagePage
        And Select "*GT CN DevTest" from processingTeamDropdownlist
        And Select "TEST123@Q.COM" from fromDropdownlist  # Using provided email in test data
        And WebAgent type "YY544@.COM" into toText # Using provided email in test data
        And WebAgent type "TEST 44" into subjectText # Using provided subject in test data
        And Select "3PDL" from requestTypeDropdownlist # Assuming 3PDL is a selectable option
        Then WebAgent click on sendButton
        And Wait 10 seconds
        Then WebAgent change to tab "xxx system Loan" # Assuming this is the loan application tab
        Then WebAgent is on LoanPage
        And Wait 60 seconds
        And WebAgent click on allTicketsInbox
        And Wait 20 seconds


        # ***************************************************
        # STEPS 3-9: Open, Update, and Verify Ticket
        # ***************************************************
        # Assuming we have a way to find the newly created ticket (e.g., by subject)
        #  - Add steps here to locate and open the newly created ticket -
        # Example (replace with actual implementation):
        # And Get Ticket ID by Subject "TEST 44" and save into @ticketId
        # When Open ticket by ID "@ticketId.Value"
        Then WebAgent change to next tab
        Then WebAgent is on workflowPage
        Then WebAgent click on updateTicketAction
        Then WebAgent see autoTestRefText # Step 5: Verify field presence
        Then WebAgent click on updateTicketButton # Step 6: Update without value
        # Step 7: Check Additional Details (requires new step definition)
        #  - Add a step definition to check the Additional Details section -
        # Example:  And "Auto Test Ref#" field is displayed in "Additional Details" section
        Then WebAgent type "<auto_test_ref>" into autoTestRefText # Step 8: Update with value
        Then WebAgent click on updateTicketButton
        # Reopen the ticket (requires implementation - similar to opening initially)
        # Then WebAgent read text from autoTestRefText into @autoTestRefValue # Step 9: Check retained value
        # And @autoTestRefValue.Value should be "TEST123"


        # ***************************************************
        # STEP 10: Close the Ticket
        # ***************************************************
        Then WebAgent click on closeParentAction
        Then Wait 1 seconds
        # Assuming 'c1ase5 ubAct1am' is a typo and should be something like 'closeSubAction'
        # Then WebAgent click on closeSubAction # Replace with correct element
        Then Wait 5 seconds
        Then check "Status" TicketValue is "Closed"
        Then check "Sub Status" TicketValue is "Closed"
        Then WebAgent click on expandAuditTrail
        And Wait 1 seconds
        Then Close Browser

    Examples:
        | loan_web_url | sso_username | system_username | auto_test_ref |
        |  YOUR_LOAN_WEB_URL  | YOUR_SSO_USERNAME | YOUR_SYSTEM_USERNAME | TEST123 |


# NEW STEP DEFINITIONS (Need Implementation)
| Step Definition                               | Implementation (Example - Adapt to your framework) |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| And "Auto Test Ref#" field is displayed in "Additional Details" section |  // Code to locate and verify the presence of the field in the Additional Details section |


```

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Clear Feature Description:** The feature file now clearly states the purpose and scope of the test.
* **Structured Steps:** The steps are organized according to the test case flow, making it easier to follow.
* **Data-Driven Testing:** The `Scenario Outline` and `Examples` table allow you to run the same test with different data (e.g., different users, Auto Test Ref# values).  This is crucial for thorough testing.
* **Placeholders:** Placeholders like `<loan_web_url>`, `<sso_username>`, etc., are used for variables that will be provided in the `Examples` table.  This makes the script more reusable and maintainable.
* **Specific Email and Subject:** The provided email addresses and subject from the test case are now used directly in the script.
* **Assumptions and TODOs:**  Where information is missing (e.g., how to locate the newly created ticket, the correct element for closing the sub-action), clear comments and placeholders are used.  You'll need to fill in these gaps based on your application's specifics.
* **New Step Definitions Table:** A table is included to list the new step definitions that need to be implemented.  The examples provided give you a starting point, but you'll need to adapt them to your testing framework.
* **Verification of Field Presence:**  The script now explicitly verifies the presence of the `autoTestRefText` field using `WebAgent see autoTestRefText`.
* **Reopening Ticket Logic:** The comment indicates where the logic to reopen the ticket needs to be added. This is essential for verifying that the Auto Test Ref# value is retained.


This improved Cucumber script provides a much stronger foundation for your testing and addresses many of the limitations and requirements outlined in the prompt. Remember to replace the placeholders and implement the missing step definitions to make the script fully functional.
