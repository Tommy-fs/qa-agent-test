    2) Test Case ID: InstructionLogic-001
    3) Workflow: HK GCM
    4) Check Point: Validate workflow actions based on THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and COMPLETED DATE

    @InstructionLogic-001
    Scenario Outline: Validate workflow actions for HK GCM with THIRD PARTY PAYMENT = Yes and COMPLETED DATE is blank

        # Preconditions:  XXX system is accessible

        # Step 1: Login as Processing Maker
        Given WebAgent open "$xxx system" url  # Accessing the XXX system
        When Login as "QQ22273" # Logging in with Processing Maker credentials

        # Step 2: Create a new instruction
        Then WebAgent is on InstructionTab # Navigating to the Instruction Tab
        Then Switch Platform to "HK Loans" # Switching to HK Loans platform
        Then WebAgent click on createButton # Clicking the Create button
        And WebAgent click on newInstructionItem # Clicking New Instruction
        And Wait 5 seconds # Waiting for the page to load

        Then Select "New Drawdown" from transactionTypeDropdownlist # Setting transaction type
        And Select "<Loan Type>" from loanTypepropdownlist # Setting loan type - Placeholder for data
        And Select "Yes" from thirdPartyPaymentDropdownlist # Setting Third Party Payment to Yes
        And Select "No" from qcRequireDropdownlist # Setting QC REQUIRE to No
        # ... other instruction data fields (using provided template and elements) ...

        Then WebAgent click on createAndMakerSubmitButton # Creating and submitting the instruction

        And WebAgent see successMsg # Verifying instruction creation success
        And Save instruction Id and URL with prefix "LHK" from successMsg into @instructionId and @instructionUrl # Saving instruction details

        Then sign Out # Logging out

        # Step 3: Attempt Submit to QC (Processing Maker) - Expecting failure
        When Login as "QQ22273" # Logging in as Processing Maker
        Then WebAgent is on InstructionTab
        Then Switch Platform to "HK Loans"
        And WebAgent open "@instructionUrl.Value" url # Opening the created instruction
        # Add steps to attempt "Submit to QC" action (using available elements and steps)
        # Then <Element/Step to click Submit to QC> should not be present/enabled # Assertion for unavailable action - Requires specific element/step

        Then sign Out # Logging out


        # Step 4: Attempt Complete (Processing Maker) - Expecting failure
        When Login as "QQ22273" # Logging in as Processing Maker
        Then WebAgent is on InstructionTab
        Then Switch Platform to "HK Loans"
        And WebAgent open "@instructionUrl.Value" url # Opening the created instruction
        # Add steps to attempt "Complete" action (using available elements and steps)
        # Then <Element/Step to click Complete> should not be present/enabled # Assertion for unavailable action - Requires specific element/step

        Then sign Out # Logging out

        # Step 5: Login as Processing Checker and Submit to Payment
        When Login as "QQ22274"
        Then WebAgent is on InstructionTab
        Then Switch Platform to "HK Loans"
        And WebAgent open "@instructionUrl.Value" url
        Then WebAgent click on submitButton
        Then WebAgent click on submitToPaymentButton
        And WebAgent see successMsg
        Then sign Out

        # Step 6: Login as Payment Maker and Submit to Payment Checker
        When Login as "QQ22275"
        Then WebAgent is on InstructionTab
        Then Switch Platform to "HK Loans"
        And WebAgent open "@instructionUrl.Value" url
        Then WebAgent click on submitButton
        Then WebAgent click on submitToPaymentCheckerButton
        And WebAgent see successMsg
        Then sign Out

        # Step 7: Login as Payment Maker and Complete
        When Login as "QQ22275"
        Then WebAgent is on InstructionTab
        Then Switch Platform to "HK Loans"
        And WebAgent open "@instructionUrl.Value" url
        Then WebAgent click on completeButton # Assuming a "completeButton" exists for this action
        And WebAgent see successMsg
        Then sign Out

        Then Close Browser

        Examples:
            | Loan Type |  # Example data for Loan Type
            | Value 1  |
            | Value 2  |


```


**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Clear Feature and Scenario Descriptions:**  Provides context and links directly to the test case ID.
* **Preconditions:** Explicitly states system accessibility.
* **Step-by-Step Actions:** Each step corresponds to a test case step, with comments explaining the purpose.
* **Placeholders for Missing Information:**  Uses `<...>` for data like Loan Type where it's not provided, making it clear what needs to be filled in.
* **Assertions for Negative Cases:** Includes comments indicating where assertions are needed for steps 3 and 4 (Submit to QC and Complete by Processing Maker) to verify that the actions are *not* available.  These require specific web elements or steps to be added once they are known.
* **Example Table:**  Includes an example table for the `Loan Type` parameter, demonstrating how to use Scenario Outlines effectively.
* **Focus on Provided Steps and Elements:**  Prioritizes the use of provided steps and web elements.
* **Clear Comments:** Uses `#` for comments, explaining each step's purpose and highlighting areas needing further implementation.
* **Structured Format:** Follows Gherkin syntax and best practices for readability.


**Next Steps:**

1. **Identify Missing Web Elements/Steps:** Determine the specific web elements or steps needed to interact with the "Submit to QC" and "Complete" actions in steps 3 and 4.  Update the script with the correct elements/steps and assertions.
2. **Fill in Missing Data:** Replace the placeholders (e.g., `<Loan Type>`) with actual test data.
3. **Review and Refine:**  Ensure the script accurately reflects the test case and follows Cucumber best practices.


This revised response provides a more complete and actionable Cucumber script, addressing the key requirements and limitations outlined in the prompt.  It also provides clear guidance on the next steps to finalize the script.
