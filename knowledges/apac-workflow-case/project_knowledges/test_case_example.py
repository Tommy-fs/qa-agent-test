Instruction test case guide
    1. You need to detect the work flow involved according to the JIRA requirements, and then generate different test cases to test different work flow scenarios.
    2. For each test case, you need to create a new instruction instead of opening an instruction. The test data can be the general data required for production, but some special fields need to be specified.
    3. You need to log in different roles to perform different operations on the instruction.
    4. You need to test a complete work flow in one test case.
    5. THIRD PARTY PAYMENT and QC REQUIRE field is the fields user can choose yes or no. 
    6. The Complete data is a field that is automatically set by the system and cannot be modified manually by the user. The ticket will only have the complete data field when the Complete action is completed. You cannot fill this field when creating an instruction.
