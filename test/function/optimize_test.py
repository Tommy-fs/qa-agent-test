**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Clear Feature Description:**  Provides context about the workflow being tested.
* **Test Case ID Tag:**  `@HK_GCM_Workflow-001` clearly links the script to the test case.
* **Preconditions:** Added a placeholder for preconditions.
* **Focus on the Test Case:** The script now concentrates on the steps specifically outlined in HK_GCM_Workflow-001, omitting unrelated template sections.
* **Verification Steps:** Added placeholders for crucial verification steps like checking available actions and the final "COMPLETED" status and date.  You'll need to implement the actual Cucumber steps for these based on your system's specifics.
* **Combined Actions:** Streamlined some sequences of actions (e.g., Payment Maker/Checker) to be more concise.
* **Example Parameters:**  Added example parameters using the `<...>` notation as required.  Include any other parameters your steps might need.
* **Comments:**  Explanations added to clarify the logic and purpose of different sections.
* **Assumptions:**  Where the test case was ambiguous (e.g., which user performs the final "Complete" action, how "Submit to Payment" is initiated), I've made reasonable assumptions and noted them in comments.  You'll need to adjust these based on your actual system.


**Next Steps:**

1. **Implement Missing Steps:** Replace the placeholder comments (e.g., `# Implement a step to...`) with actual Cucumber step definitions that interact with your web application.
2. **Define Step Definitions:**  Create the code behind the Cucumber steps in your step definition files.  These will use your web automation framework (e.g., Selenium) to interact with the browser and perform the actions.
3. **Complete Example Table:** Fill in the `<...>` placeholders in the `Examples` table with real test data.
4. **Review and Refine:**  Carefully review the generated script against the test case to ensure it accurately reflects the intended test flow and covers all verification points.


This revised structure provides a much stronger foundation for a working Cucumber script that directly addresses the requirements of your test case. Remember to adapt it further based on the specifics of your testing environment and framework.

```


**Key Changes and Explanations:**

* **Background Step for Login:**  Login is now handled in a `Background` step, eliminating redundant login/logout steps and making the scenario cleaner.
* **Consolidated Steps:** Steps within each user's actions are grouped together for better readability.
* **Placeholder for Payment Maker Actions:** A placeholder `And Payment Maker performs actions` is added.  Fill this in with the specific steps the Payment Maker needs to take.
* **Parameterization:** The `Instruction ID` and `Instruction URL` are now parameterized, allowing you to reuse the same scenario outline for different instructions.  These values would be generated during the instruction creation step and passed along.
* **Clearer Step Descriptions:** Step descriptions are more concise and directly relate to the test case steps.
* **Given-When-Then Structure:**  The scenario outline now follows a clearer Given-When-Then structure, improving readability and organization.
* **Focus on Test Case:** The script is now tightly focused on the steps in the test case, removing unnecessary parts from the template.


**Next Steps:**

1. **Implement Step Definitions:**  The most crucial next step is to implement the actual Cucumber step definitions for each of the steps in the scenario outline.  These step definitions will use your web automation framework (e.g., Selenium) to interact with the application and perform the actions.
2. **Define Custom Steps:** Create custom steps like "Maker creates a new HK GCM instruction with THIRD PARTY PAYMENT set to "Yes"", "Only "Submit to Payment" action is available", and "COMPLETED DATE is populated" using your web automation framework.  These steps will contain the logic to interact with the specific web elements on your application's pages.
3. **Populate Examples Table:**  Replace the placeholders in the `Examples` table with actual test data, including the system URL and potentially other parameters needed for your test.  The `<Instruction ID>` and `<Instruction URL>` will be dynamically generated during the test execution.


This improved script provides a much stronger structure and addresses many of the previous issues.  By implementing the step definitions and populating the examples table, you'll have a complete and executable Cucumber script for your test case.
